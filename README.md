# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game in C

This is a terminal-based 2-player **Tic Tac Toe** game written in **C**.  
It allows two users to play turn-by-turn, automatically checks for **winning conditions**, and offers an option to **restart** the game after a draw.

---

## 📌 Features

- Turn-based player system (User 1 & User 2)
- Supports input by selecting numbers from **1 to 9**
- Automatically checks for:
  - Win by row, column, or diagonal
  - Draw condition
- Option to play again after the game ends
- Clear ASCII-based board display with user-friendly layout

---

## 🎯 How to Play

- The board is represented as follows:

```

## 1 | 2 | 3

## 4 | 5 | 6

## 7 | 8 | 9

````

- On your turn, input a number between **1 to 9** to place your symbol (`X` or `O`) in that position.
- Player 1 selects either `X` or `O`, and Player 2 is assigned the remaining symbol.
- The game ends when a player wins or the board is full (draw).
- After a draw, you'll be asked if you want to play again.
